# covid_recovery
A project visualizing the recovery efforts from COVID-19 through the lens of travel.

## Motivating question:
How have room-sharing services fared over the pandemic?

It's pretty easy to conclude they suffered greatly during the international health crisis. However, the figures don't seem to reflect the same information.


## Conclusion:
From the datasets, we notice there was a significant dip in revenue leading into the pandemic. This is assumed to be tenants taking their offers off the 
site to prevent the spread of the pandemic. 

In the dataset for 2021, we notice businesses increase in productivity once again. However, I notice there has been a surge of listings after the pandemic. 
This is likely the rebound from several years of stagnation and due to the industry attempting to promote listings again.
